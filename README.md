increasing retention and satisfaction.

## Objective
- To understand the diverse backgrounds of Edu-tech learners, especially regarding their current roles, companies, and experience. 
- Clustering similar learners helps customize the learning experience, thereby increasing retention and satisfaction. 
- Analyzing the vast data of learners can uncover patterns in their professional backgrounds and preferences. This allows Edu-tech companies to make tailored content recommendations and provide specialized mentorship. 
- By leveraging data science and unsupervised learning, particularly clustering techniques, Edu-tech company can group learners with similar profiles, aiding in delivering a more personalized learning journey.

## Approach
This notebook does the data preprocessing, followed by feature engineering, Univariate/ Bivariate analysis, and later clustering algorithms (KMeans, Hierarchical) are applied to identify the characteristics of learners.
